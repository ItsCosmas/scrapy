# scrapy
Web Scrapper
- The notebook contains the code for my process in extracting jobs from the [ihub jobs website](https://ihub.co.ke/jobs)
- I saved the jobs as a csv file that I'll export to mongodb
- Check out the scrapy-edge repository where I build a flask endpoint to expose the jobs for use in a frontend app
which I'll also build.
